# 2023-2024-VRC_OverUnder-PCFresh
**The definitive Repository for the 2023-2024 VRC Over Under for the Pine Crest Upper School Freshman Robotics Team (#lolol)**
There are 2(+?) teams for the Pine Crest VEX VRC Robotics competition. This is the Freshman Team for the 2023-2024 Season. The Code here will contain, but is not limited to, all driving and autonomous code.

## Set Up

### Installation
**All instructions must be followed IN ORDER, as each depends on the last**
First, follow these instructions to download PROS (and VS Code, if necessary): [https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/)

Then, install the specific library we are using: [https://okapilib.github.io/OkapiLib/md_docs_tutorials_walkthrough_gettingStarted.html](https://okapilib.github.io/OkapiLib/md_docs_tutorials_walkthrough_gettingStarted.html)

I would recommend connecting your GitHub account to the built-in VS Code source control manager, to make pushing and pulling faster:[ https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github)

## Contributing

**ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU START EDITING**
